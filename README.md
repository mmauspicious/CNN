**Problem 5 : Concrete Defect**  

•	Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on Kaggle dataset [1].

•	Defects in concrete structures—cosmetic or structural—can undermine overall performance and, if left unaddressed, may contribute to long-term deterioration. Although many defects start as minor issues without an immediate impact on structural integrity, their cumulative effects can pose significant safety and financial risks over time. Therefore, even seemingly negligible imperfections require prompt attention.

•	A primary cause of concrete failure is an inadequate bearing capacity coupled with suboptimal behavior under diverse loading conditions. Defects accelerate deterioration by compromising the structure’s designed performance. Understanding the contributing factors to these defects and the methods for their remediation is crucial for extending a structure’s lifespan, enhancing durability, and mitigating potential risks to human safety and economic loss. Common causes include design errors, overloading, seismic activity, severe storms, and material wear.

•	Concrete offers several notable advantages: its high compressive strength, malleability, and durability make it ideal for earthquake-resistant buildings, while its inherent heat and sound insulation properties and versatile mold applications further contribute to its appeal. Additionally, concrete is cost-effective, readily available, compatible with steel due to similar thermal expansion coefficients, and exhibits excellent fire resistance.

•	Nonetheless, concrete also presents challenges. Its low tensile strength, tendency for expansion and contraction, and inherent permeability can compromise performance. Furthermore, concrete is vulnerable to alkali and sulfate attacks, is relatively heavy, may experience creep under sustained loads, and typically requires skilled labor for proper installation and maintenance.
